# Serenity Chess Engine

** by Pat Snyder**

Serenity is an artificial intelligence chess engine written in Python. It is an experiment in creating an agentic chess engine that can learn and adapt to different playing styles. It's agentic nature allows it to deploy various models to approach different positions and scenarios. This work is based on the most modern techniques in AI and machine learning, including reinforcement learning, neural networks, deep learning, and most significantly, the concept of agentic model architecture.
